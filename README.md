# Learning Eiffel - Conditionals as Functions
This is roughly the code (with imrpovements) that was used in the making of the Learning Eiffel video found at: https://youtu.be/4W5SN1d7pOc

The intent of this code is to demonstrate how to use if-then and inspect conditional grammar structures as functions to conditionally isolate an object for assignment to a target variable or attribute.
